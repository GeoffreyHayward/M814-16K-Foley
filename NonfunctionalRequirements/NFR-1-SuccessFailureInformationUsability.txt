Originator: Lucy Withington
Comments: 
[Tony Lin] I would argue for stricter fit criteria - perhaps even a 100% success rate. The business will be keen on not having a single payment slip through the net, as the consequences could prove disatrous for some larger transactions. At least, I would remove the caveat of five attempts.
