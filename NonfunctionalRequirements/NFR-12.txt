REQ-ID: NFR-12
Description: Check to make sure that individual is a member should be quick
Type: 12
Rationale: Member identification should not create a substantial delay when other users simultaneously perform resource intensive tasks such as report generation
Fit Criterion: Under the load of 50 simultaneous users performing report generation, system takes no more than 500ms to return a response for at least 95% of requests

[James Peters] Possible gold plating. 50 simultaneous users seems like quite alot of users for the WIMS and the 500ms is quite a short time under that kind of load.
Maybe it would be a good idea to reduce the number of users and increase the wait time slighlty.
