REQ-ID: NFR-7
Description: A user should be able to quickly locate a copy of a specified
past report
Type: 11 - Usability 
Rationale: In order to compare performance, the user needs to be able to
access previous reports. If this is difficult, the user will get frustrated and
this feature won’t get used
Fit Criterion: In at least 85% of instances, a user should be able to locate a
specified report within 25 seconds.
Originator: Sam Bates
Comment [Geoffrey Hayward] It is unclear if the fit criterion relates to a type 12a ‘speed and latency’ or type 11a ‘ease of use’. As you have specified type 11, I would suggest changing ‘… able to locate a specified report …’ to ‘… able to specify a search criterion for locating a report …’.
