REQ-ID: NFR-9
Description: The Membership Search shall be easy and fast to operate.
Type: 11 - Learning requirements
Rationale: The system must be easy to use without adding to the workload, for example, when taking bookings over the phone. 
Fit Criterion: Fully trained clerks will be able to operate the Membership Search facility with just the keyboard, so that a search criterion can be entered in less than 10 seconds in 90% of the times.
Originator: Marion Harkin
[Thejas Kumar] I think it is good to have a safety margin to the fit criterion. E.g. After 30 minutes of training all clerks will be able to operate the Membership Search facility with just the keyboard, so that a search criterion can be entered in less than 10 seconds in 90% of the times.
[Adam Boothroyd] I aggree with Thejas regarding the safety margin. Additionally, I think the 30 minutes specified training time could be too short. It might not be necessary to specify a time limit for training. One could instead say 'Fully trained clerks will be able to operate the Membership Search facility with just the keyboard, so that a search criterion can be entered in less than 10 seconds in 90% of the times'.
[Jacek S Kutyla] I think it may be dangerous to assume that all clerks are capable of being trained in a timely manner. I would add some safety margin here.
[Sam Bates] It might even be that by suggesting "Fully trained clerks will be able to operate the Membership Search facility with just the keyboard", you're suggesting a solution. I think this aspect could actually be left out - there's no need to specify using the keyboard in order to obtain high speed of operation.
