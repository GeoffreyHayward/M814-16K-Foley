REQ-ID: NFR-3
Description: The product shall check payment validity as quickly as possible.
Type: Type 12, Performance.
Rationale: This allows staff to notify a customer immediately about a failed payment.
Fit Criterion: The payment is approved or rejected in 3 seconds or less (with a 1 second margin of error).
Originator: Tony Lin
Comments: 
[Lucy Withington] The margin of error would only be needed if you were aiming for a target time of 3s (i.e. 3s +/- 1s). Your target is <= 3s (or perhaps you want the target to be <=4s). The business might want to test the adjacent system that takes part in this transaction; is <=3s realistically achievable 100% of the time? If not, the fit criteria could be adjusted to be <=3s 95% of the time and never more than 10s (MRP p292).
[Geoffrey Hayward] WIMS has no control over the cooperative adjacent system. I would suggest including a breakdown that splits the responsibility. #1 The system will dispatch a validation request in less than 200 milliseconds, and will process the response in less than 200 milliseconds. #2 The selected adjacent system will have a 2 second (or less) service level agreement. The other 600 milliseconds accounts for network delay.
