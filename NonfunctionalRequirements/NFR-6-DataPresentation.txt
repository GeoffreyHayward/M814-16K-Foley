[JacekSKutyla] Iteration 1
[Ryan Schranz] I would consider adding to the criterion what "compact form" entails and how to test the "compactness"
[Adam Boothroyd] Further to Ryan's comment, you could create a criterion for a certain percentage of the total activities fitting on a standard resolution screen.
[JacekSKutyla] Iteration 2 - after reviewing comments provided by Ryan and Adam I have amended my fit criterion to clearly describe how to measure my requirement.
