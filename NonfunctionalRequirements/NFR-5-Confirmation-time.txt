REQ-ID: NFR-5
Description: The product shall provide a confirmation of booking in a short period of time to the user.  
Type: 12 - Performance Requirements
Rationale: To reduce the time it takes for the overall booking.
Fit Criterion: The product shall provide a confirmation of booking in less than 3 seconds in 97% of bookings.
Originator: Daniel Steimetz
[JacekSKutyla] I would consider adding some safety margins to the fit criterion, for instance: The confirmation should take no longer than 3 seconds in 95% of payments. (I made a similar comment to NFR-2)
[D Steimetz] I agree with you JacekSKutyla on the safety margins.
[Adam Boothroyd] This fit criterion seems quite strict. Given that it is not essential for confirmations to be sent instantly, would it not be better to extend the time to circa 10 seconds to make this criterion more easily achievable?
