Originator: Adam Boothroyd
Comments:
[Lucy Withington] The fit criterion is satisfactory. You might consider refining it to what type of person the user is (MRP p49), this could be based on the type of new members that the centre is targeting. You might also specify what type of device this fit applies to; it can take longer to fill in forms on a tablet than on a PC. Consider whether the user's internet connection speed might affect performance.
