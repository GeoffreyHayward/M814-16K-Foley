# Guidelines for Junie (and other developers)
All requirements are kept within this repository.

**Important for all changes:** 
- All functional requirements `REQ-ID: FR-` and are found `WaltonSustainabilityCentre-Requirements.txt`
- Each non-functional `REQ-ID: NFR-` and are found in the folder named `NonfunctionalRequirements`
- When implementing a functional requirements:
  - Include code changes
  - Include automated tests changes
  - Include descriptive help-pages, written in Markdown, in the `user-manual` folder. Also, when requirements change, keep the user manual in sync. 
  - Keep the developer guide, found in the `developer-guide` folder, in sync with all changes.
  - Feel free to add and edit requirements when you see gaps. You are also free to add comments to requirements in the corresponding `Comments:` section (Comment as `Junin AI` within the commenter name block).
